Just getting some sort of idea of how to use git on local repositries and also online repositories.
git init (to initialized a git instance in to local repository)
git add . (to add all files to stagging area)
git commit -m "message" (to commit changes to your file)
git status (to check status of your files, i.e. are they in stagging area or changes committed)
git branch (to check all available branches)
git branch branch_name (to create a branch)
git checkout branch_name (to change current directory to branch_name)
